# 🛍️ Branding Merchants Shops

We have open-sourced all the Bitcoin resources our founder uses to onboard merchants for Bitcoin payments. This includes merchandise and stickers. The files are available in PDF and Adobe Illustrator (Ai) formats, along with mockup images.

## 🎨 How to Use the Resources

### 📥 Downloading and Printing
- If you want to use the designs as they are, simply download the PDF files and take them to your local printing service provider.
- If you're familiar with Adobe Illustrator, feel free to download the Ai files to modify the language, resize, or make other adjustments as needed.

### 🖌️ Customization
- The "Bitcoin Accepted Here" second sticker includes a thin square outline where you can include the merchant’s paycode QR code for Lightning payments.

## 📸 Examples in Action
